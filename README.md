empirical research.

Practice R introduces R to social science students, inspiring them to
consider R as an excellent choice. In a non-technical pragmatic way,
this book covers all typical steps of applied empirical research.

Learn how to prepare, analyze, and visualize data in R. Discover how to
collect data, generate reports, or automate error-prone tasks.

The book is accompanied by an R package. This provides further learning
materials that include interactive tutorials, challenging you with
typical problems of applied research. This way, you can immediately
practice the knowledge you have learned. The package also includes the
source code of each chapter and templates that help to create reports.

Practice R has social science students in mind, nonetheless a broader
audience may use Practice R to become a proficient R user.
